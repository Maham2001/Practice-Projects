                <h2>Missile Man of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b>, NI, HI, FPAS (/ˈɑːbdəl ˈkɑːdɪər ˈkɑːn/ (listen); Urdu: عبد القدیر خان; 1 April 1936 – 10 October 2021),[3] known as A. Q. Khan, was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the "father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program".[a]
<br/> An émigré (Muhajir) from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years.</p>
